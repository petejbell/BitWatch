# 'BitWatch' 
A Binary Watch programme written in MicroPython for the BBC Micro:bit by @petejbell and distributed under a MIT licence
Please share with me what you do with it, I'd love to see what you do!
You can find a tutorial showing you how to build a strap for your watch here: https://t.co/li9CktVJhg

Instructions:
1)  Download Mu from here: https://github.com/ntoll/mu
2)  Copy and paste this BitWatch code to Mu, connect your Micro:bit to your computer and then flash the code to your Micro:bit
3)  The BitWatch will display 18:50 as the time for 10 seconds and will then show '18:51'.
    Use Button A to set the Hours and B to set the Minutes. Hold each one down and you will see the hours/minutes increment.
    Use Buttons A+B together to reset seconds to '0'.
    
    Column 0 shows the first digit in the hours (in 24hr clock)
    Column 1 shows the second digit.
    Column 2 shows the seconds flashing away.
    Column 3 shows the first digit in the minutes
    Column 4 shows the second digit.
